description=TinyDungeon is an old school dungeon crawler (inspired by the games of the 80s like "The Bards Tale" or "Dungeon Master"). The goal of the game is to find the Water of Life to save your love from a mysterious desease. The fountain is rumored to be in the depth of a dark and creepy dungeon... (I'm working on a more elaborate version of the story ;P) The dungeon contains some nasty things like teleporters and spinners, so it is strongly recommended to draw a map. Oh, there are monsters, too! ;)
